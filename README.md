# CSS Notes

This repository is dedicated to consult from vertocode.

You can use to consult too!

I post materials about this repository on my blog in the [CSS section](https://blog.vertocode.com/#/css).

## Flexbox

The flex layout allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending on viewport size

## Match elements with `^`, `$`, `*` and `~`

We were able to use these characters in selectors to filter which ones we want to be modifying in CSS or testing in some testing framework like Cypress or Playwright.
